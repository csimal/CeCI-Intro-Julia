To run the program in this folder, you need to open a Pluto notebook. If you followed the package installation steps, Pluto should already be installed as in your local julia environment.

To open Pluto, open a Julia REPL and enter the following

```julia-repl
julia> using Pluto

julia> Pluto.run()
```

This will open a tab in your browser, from which you'll be able to select the file `microprocessor-benchmarks.jl` file and run it.
