# CÃ©CI Training Days: Introduction to Julia

Julia is a recent (2012) programming language created at the MIT with the aim to provide performance on par with the likes of C and Fortran, with the ease of use of languages like Python and Matlab. The goal of this session is to introduce the key ideas of Julia while giving as many pointers for getting started as possible.

Contents:

- Installing Julia
- Basics of Julia
- Multiple Dispatch
- Installing and managing packages


## Running the examples in this repo

You'll first need to install Julia on your computer. To do that, the easiest way is to use [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup) to install the latest version (v1.9.3).

To run the notebooks, you'll at least need a Jupyter installation. The easiest way for that would be to install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or it's fully open source fork [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/)), and then install the [Julia Extension](https://www.julia-vscode.org/docs/dev/gettingstarted/) along with the [Jupyter extension](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter) (Both of these are available from the Plugin tab in VSCode)

Alternatively, you can just install Jupyter (via `pip`) and install the Julia Jupyter kernel. To do that, launch Julia in a terminal and enter the following line
```
] add IJulia
```
Once the package is installed, you'll be able to select Julia as a kernel in Jupyter notebooks.
